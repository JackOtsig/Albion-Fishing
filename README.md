# Albion-Fishing
A simple Albion Online fishing b0t. I just wanted opencv practice and it ended up being fun.

does not work currently
reworking the initial bobber searching mechaninc led to a problem with coordinates of pixels in later functions so I'm just going through checking pixels at random hoping they are what I'm looking for kill me please this is taking so long

Defunct for now
I started playing the game as coding practice but now I like it and don't wanna get banned
